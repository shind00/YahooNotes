### Pre-requisites
1) Download the Yahoo News app from the Play Store or the App Store.
2) Ensure you have an app for taking notes (e.g. Keep Notes for Android, Notes for iOS, or other)

### Write a test that does the following:
1) Open the Yahoo News app, and go to the main screen
2) Retrieve the values of the tabs at the bottom of the main screen
3) Go to a notes app of your choice
4) Create a new note
5) Paste the retrieved headers in a comma-separated fashion

To re-emphasize, this is to be written as a test.

It is recommended to use Appium to drive the test, and while Python as a language is preferred, you may use any
language you feel most comfortable with.

We are as interested in your thought process as we are in the answers; please show your work whenever possible. This
might include high-level approach and rationale, assumptions made, solution detail, or verification steps.

You should treat this as production-level code that can be used for testing real applications in production. The code
should be written with an emphasis on evolvability and maintainability.

Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this assignment. If you eclipse the 2-hour mark, you may stop your work with
what you have.

You will be expected to run this test or set of tests as part of a live demonstration. If you could not get a fully compiled
test, be expected to walk us through what you would do to get to that point.

When youâ€™ve completed your assignment, please either zip your files and send them to us or use GitLab to send us the
repository.

Thanks for your excitement and continued interest. Good luck!
